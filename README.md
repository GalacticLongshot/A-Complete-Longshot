Reasons why my brain hurts:
* I barely know what I am doing.
 * Code is confusting.
 * I half to do this.

###### Update: I've gone insane.

It's been a long day without you, my friend  
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
We've come a long way from where we began  
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
When I see you again  

Damn, who knew?  
All the planes we flew, good things we been through  
That I'd be standing right here talking to you  
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh  
But something told me that it wouldn't last  
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture  
Those were the days, hard work forever pays  
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)  
Uh  

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?  
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side  
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride  

It's been a long day without you, my friend  
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)  
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)  
From where we began (you know we started)  
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)  
When I see you again  

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong  
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond  
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost  
(The love will never get lost)  
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed  
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn  
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone  
(Remember me when I'm gone)  

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?  
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side  
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride  

So let the light guide your way, yeah  
Hold every memory as you go  
And every road you take  
Will always lead you home, home  

It's been a long day without you, my friend  
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
We've come a long way from where we began

When I see you again  

When I see you again (yeah, uh)  
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)  

When I see you again
